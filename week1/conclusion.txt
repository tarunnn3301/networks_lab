\f0\fs24 \cf0 1. When we tried to run TCP Client without running TCP Server, we got an error. We were not able to connect with the TCP Server. This happens because TCP protocol first tries to establish a secure connection between Server and Client, and after that only it sends data. In this case, the secure connection is not able to be made because server doesn't exists.\
2. When we tried to run UDP Client without running UDP Server, no error occurs and the code runs perfectly. This happens because UDP protocol doesn't need any connection between Client and Server before sending data. So in this case the code works despite the server not running.}
